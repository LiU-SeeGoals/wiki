## Feature Branch Integration

### Squash Commits
Make sure to squash ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5KrD7CmO4o)) smaller commits before integration.

### Rebase
Use rebase ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1wnYdLEpgI)), not merge! Workflow:
1. Rebase feature branch with destination branch on the feature branch.
2. Merge rebased feature branch into destination branch.

**NOTE** If many commits - squash them according previous heading.
