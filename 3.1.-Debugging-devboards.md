# NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q

## Can't connect to STLINK
Quick checks:
1. JP2 is shorted on STLINK.
2. LD6 (by the st-link LED) is on (alerting on USB overcurrent request). Most likely U11 will be pretty hot as well. Probably something shorted somewhere.

Easiest way to debug is generally with the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#get-software). These settings should work:

The following from the [datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2408-stm32h7-nucleo144-boards-mb1363-stmicroelectronics.pdf) might be of interest (bottom of page 25):
- Board SMPS/LDO firmware power configuration must match with the hardware configuration. If not, the user faces a deadlock: after the reset, STLINK can't connect the target anymore.
- If a deadlock is faced due to a mismatch between the hardware board setting and the firmware setting (LDO/SMPS), the user can recover the board by doing the following:
- Power off the board
- Connect CN11 ‘BT0’ pin (BOOT0) to VDD using a wire
- This changes the BOOT0 pin to HIGH instead of LOW and thus the device boot address is changed to boot address 1 making the bootloader starting in System memory, instead of starting the firmware in the user Flash (Firmware that is setting a wrong LDO/SMPS configuration)
- Power on the board and connect using STM32CubeProgrammer
- Erase the user Flash
- Power off the board and remove the wire between BOOT0 and VDD
- The recovery is now completed and the board can be used normally.

If you get:
`Error: No STM32 target found! If your product embeds Debug Authentication, please perform a discovery using Debug Authentication`

Then try to set mode to `Power down` and try again. You probably should erase the memory it if you're allowed to connect after that. Erase the memory by pressing the eraser button at bottom left in `STM32CubeProgrammer`: ![24-02-11-2259-08](https://github.com/LiU-SeeGoals/wiki/assets/86022094/dcc93522-faa7-4abe-94f5-e69e0962509a)
