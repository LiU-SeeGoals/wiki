This wiki contains documentation for the ToeBiters project. It's used to store public information that could be of use for both team members and other teams competing in the [SSL competition](https://ssl.robocup.org/).

### Layout
There are no strict rules how the wiki should be structured, but there are some things to keep in mind when editing it.
- Try to keep related things within one page to make the wiki more navigable.
- Only when a page gets to big it should be divided into many pages.
