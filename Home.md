#### Software 
[System used to view the robots during the competition](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision/tree/master) more info in [rules](https://robocup-ssl.github.io/ssl-rules/sslrules.html#_vision).  
[For controlling matches during the competition](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-game-controller) more info in [rules](https://robocup-ssl.github.io/ssl-rules/sslrules.html#_game_controller).  
[Google protobuf (Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data)](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).  
[Timestamped ProtoBuf logs of ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller from official matches](https://ssl.robocup.org/game-logs/).  
[A simulator for SSL](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/grSim): Receiving data from the grSim is similar to receiving data from the [SSL-Vision](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision) using [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) library. Sending data to the simulator is also possible using Google Protobuf. Sample clients are included in [clients](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/grSim/blob/master/clients) folder.
