This wiki contains documentation for the ToeBiters project. It's used to store public information that could be of use for both team members and other teams competing in [SSL](https://ssl.robocup.org/).

### Layout
There are no strict rules how the wiki should be structured, but there are some things to keep in mind when editing it.
- The wiki is for concrete documentation or guides (e.x. how to access fetdatorn, how to build some software, what parts the robot is currently made of, how the project is organised). It's not for discussions.
- The wiki is open to the world, private things should be in the sharepoint.
- Try to keep related things within one page to make the wiki more navigable.
- Only when a page gets to big it should be divided into many pages.
