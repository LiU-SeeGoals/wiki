## Access the cameras
The cameras are only accessible from fetdatorn. They're of the model **AXIS M3005 Network Camera**. There are four cameras but only two are configured. To access stream on Linux: `ffplay –fflags nobuffer –flags low_delay rtsp://root:<password>@192.168.1.1/axis-media/media.amp`. It's also possible to access the cameras by typing the ip-address into a browser. NOTE, try to access the cameras by using a browser using the information below before continuing.

### Camera 1 (closest to corridor)
- Username/password: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYqpy--IQllFhHvlJd8Hz6MNWORbsYfvObYwvCFx8y4/edit)
- Network: The switch at fetdatorn
- IP: 192.168.1.1/24

### Camera 3 (closest to computers)
- Username/password: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYqpy--IQllFhHvlJd8Hz6MNWORbsYfvObYwvCFx8y4/edit)
- Network: The switch at fetdatorn
- IP: 192.168.1.3/24

### Can't connect?
If you can't connect to the cameras, do the following:
1. Run the command `ip addr`
2. Check if `enp4s0` has the IP `192.168.1.10/24`. 
3. If not, run the command `sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev enp4s0`

## Download repo 
Download the repo ssl-vision from the SeeGoals git and switch to the branch called `image-file-reading`.

## Run SSL-Vision
Before you can run SSL-Vision, it needs to be compiled. Before compiling, one modification needs to be made in `InstallPackagesUbuntu.sh`: change "22.04" to "21". Finally run the following commands:
1. `make configure_vapix`
2. `make`

You can now run the program by typing `screen -c screen.camera` in a terminal (not in the built-in VS Code terminal). This will run 2 python scripts and SSL-vision in separate tabs. You can navigate between the tabs by pressing either `n` for next or `p` for previous. Exit by pressing `x`.

## Set up camera stream
After opening SSL-Vision, find the tree on the left side of the window. Choose a thread to put the stream on (ex `Thread 0`) and open`Image Capture -> VAPIX -> Capture Settings` and fill in the fields:
- Ip: See above
- Port: 554
- Username: See above
- Password: See above
The rest can be left as it is.

To start the stream, open `Image Capture -> Capture Control` and choose the control module `VAPIX`, finally press `start capture`.

## Field Line Calibration
To calibrate the field lines, go into the `Camera Calibration` tab in SSL-vision. The `Line Search Corridor Width` specifies the area in which SSL-vision will look for lines.

### Prerequisites
1. Place the blue points to the correct corners by dragging them. IMPORTANT the coordinates of the points must be correct.

### Calibration
1. Change the `Camera Height` and `Distortion` parameters by dragging their sliders.
2. Adjust the `Line search Corridor Width` parameter so that all lines are within the boundaries displayed in SSL-vision as blue. 
>If you can't see these lines, go to the tab `Thread x/Visualization` (x is the id of the thread you are using) and make sure the `detected edges` option is set to True.
3. Press the `Detect additional calibration points` button followed by the `Do full calibration` button.
4. If the camera position, represented in SSL-vision by a red cross, is not located at the correct location, start over from step 1.
